# CaptainsLog
Our website is made for people who enjoy posting and viewing pictures of people's sailing adventures.
On the website you can view posts made by other users even if you don't have an account.

To make posts you must be logged into your user account. If you do not own an account yet,
you can make one by using the register button.

When you want to make a post, you press the "add an entry button" to start making one. To make one you need an image, a title
and the name of your ship. After this, you're done making a post. Other users can now see your post on the frontpage. 

If the bright white of the page is too much for you, press the moon button in the lower right corner to turn on dark mode.
You can also go back to light mode by pressing the button again.

The project was made by the group TRE. It consists of Emil, Toni and Ricu. 
Emil was in charge of making our frontend.
Toni was in charge of making the backend of our project.
Ricu was in charge of the SQL side of the project.
